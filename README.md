# Dark Sky Simulation - IEEE Scientific Visualization Contest 2015

Cosmological simulations offers information to understand formation of structure in universe which helps to know about dark matter and galaxies. Dark matter is a collision-less fluid formed by discrete set of particles that interact only gravitationally.

This project provides few possible visualizations for IEEE SciVis 2015 contest, http://darksky.slac.stanford.edu/scivis2015/. The objective of the task is to provide user with a basic framework to visualize the dark matter by simulating either a halo or family of halos over a time frame. Halo is composed of large number of particles (10243) which represents the dark matter and galaxies.
